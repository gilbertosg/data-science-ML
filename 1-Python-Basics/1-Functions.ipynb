    "**Functions:**\n",
    "- Python allows you to define and call functions that you create.\n",
    "- The main components of a function are the definition statement, the body, and the output statement (usually `return` or `print`).\n",
    "    - The function header includes the `def` keyword, followed by the name of the function, followed by parantheses, followed by a colon.\n",
    "    - The function body includes an indented block of code that instructs the computer on what to do when the function is called.\n",
    "    - The output statement is what the function should produce as a result when executed.\n",
    "- Functions allow you to reuse common code.\n",
    "    - Frequently used calculations can be saved to a function and reused without writing out the equation multiple times.\n",
    "- Functions accept single or multiple parameters.\n",
    "    - Functions can be customized to accept more than one parameter and perform calculations on them, which allows greater flexibility when working with fluctuating values.\n",
    "- Including functions such as `round()` to the return statement helps keep calculated values tidy and easy to read.\n",
    "- Scaffolding functions with code comments helps improve readibility.\n",
    "    - Clearly commented code explains how the code works as well as the intended results."
